# DAC-VLSI

Here's a list of changes I've made:
- removed all the VP and VN pins in all subcircuits, and added global VDD and GND pins instead
- edited the property of all pins in all subcircuits (changed from `iopin` to `ipin` or `opin`
- updated overal circuits to the version that aligned with the email on the night of Nov 6th

Here's a list of items I haven't considered about when I was making changes:
- basically anything about simulations
